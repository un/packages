# @u22n/mailtools

`@u22n/mailtools` is a modified and more feature filled version of [`tempo-email-parser`](https://github.com/yourtempo/tempo-email-parser).

We picked up on `tempo-email-parser` which was not being maintained any more and updated it to modern tooling and dependencies. We are using this package at uninbox.com, but everyone is allowed to use it as they want.

## Features

- Parse HTML emails
- Remove quotations, trackers, styles
- Extract & remove signatures
- Clean up HTML

## Limitations

It seems like we are unable to extract outlook signatures correctly. We will be working on a fix for this.

## License

This package is licensed under the MIT License. Please see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more information.
